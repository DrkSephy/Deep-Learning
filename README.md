Sea Ice - Deep Learning
=======================

A collection of Deep Learning Algorithms, which will be used for classifying landmasses in Antartica. Currently these algorithms 
are taken from the tutorial found here: http://www.deeplearning.net/tutorial/

####Further Research

Replace the MNIST dataset with our own dataset to test the classification results.
